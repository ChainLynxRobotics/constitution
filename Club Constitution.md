## Elections
### General
- The club will hold elections at the end of the school year during a meeting, be it online or in person, the time and place of which has been agreed upon in a previous meeting.
- The team must be through the ranked-choice voting system, using the 3 step process:
1. The voter’s first choice is counted first. If after counting all the first place votes a candidate has an outright majority, that’s it. The candidate is elected.
2. If no candidate has a majority, the candidate with the fewest first place votes is eliminated first. Those votes are transferred to the second choice on the ballot. 
3. The process repeats itself as needed until a candidate has a majority and is declared the winner.
- Those who are tied have a runoff vote immediately if it is happening in person or new ballots are sent out immediately with 3 days for them to be finished if it is electronic.
- Every election the president has to make sure a guide of how to vote and everyone running is distributed to everyone participating
- The club mentors and/or the club president and/or another third party as agreed upon in a previous meeting run the election


### Timeline
- Part 1: Candidate sign up week
- Day 1: the team must announce team wide that elections are happening and what officer positions are open and a description of those positions. All members then have 1 week to sign up to run and turn in a platform of who they are, why they should be elected, what they would do as officer, and a photo of themselves. 
- Day 7: All members who want to run must have signed up and turned in their platform.

- Part 2: Election week
- Day 1: The team must release all candidate platforms to the whole club and alert the whole of the team that the ballots close at the end of the 7 days.
- Day 7: Ballots close and the coaches count votes to decide who has won.



### Conduct
- You can’t bribe, threaten or coerce people to vote for you or your preferred candidate, but you are allowed to support a campaign 
- You can endorse and discuss candidates in a public forum
- Use resources that are available to all (as approved by coaches)
- Platforms are allowed to be a maximum of 250 words
- You can’t publicly slander or disrespect people
- If a candidate breaks any of the election rules, they are removed from the ballot
- If a team member who is not running in the election breaks any of the election rules, their punishment will be decided on a case by case basis by the coaches or administration
- No student, coach, or mentor can pressure someone into running, either in general or for a specific position
- These rules can be changed at any time via the team’s process for making an amendment (a member proposes a change, and then a ⅔ vote of all active members is required to confirm the change). However, the rules for an election are locked on the date the election is announced, and no changes to the election rules may be ratified until after that election has concluded and the results have been announced.
